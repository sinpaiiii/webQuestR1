              Make in India is a “Be Indian and Made Indian” type of Swadeshi movement; covering 25 sectors of the economy. This plan was launched by the Government of India on 25 September 2014 to encourage companies to manufacture their products in India.
              The sole motive of this plan is to convert India into a Global Manufacturing Hub.
              In order to invite foreign manufacturers in the country, the Government of India has allowed 100% Foreign Direct Investment (F.D.I.) in key sectors of the economy.

           <p class="intro-para">
           Cottage Industry is a concentrated form of small scale industry where the productivity of the goods takes place in the houses of the labourers and the workforce includes the members of the family.
           They produce consumable products through the use of conventional methods. 
            These industries originate in the countryside where unemployment and under-employment are widespread. 
            But on the flip side Cottage Industry cannot be considered as the mass producer of products.

                Weaving refers to the process of interlacing yarn to produce textiles and fabrics. The vertical thread is called the warp, while the horizontal thread is referred to as the weft. Warp and weft are usually laced 
                in fixed patterns using a loom. The different ways of lacing results in varied types of weaves. A simple criss-crossing of the warp and the weft at right angles is called plain-weave. In twill-weave, the warp and weft are laced together to form a typical diagonal pattern, while four or more warp yarns
                 are floated over the weft in the satin-weave technique. In India artisans from different places have their unique styles of weaving plain and dyed yarns, leading to a range of distinguished textiles and fabrics.       </strong>

                    The one big advantage of handcrafted jewelry is that the customer gets to sit with the jeweler to decide upon the design and pattern of the jewelry. The process is a tedious one as it involves a lot of planning and finalizing on the designs and deciding on whether stones should be embedded or not. Handmade Jewelry includes bangles, bracelets, necklaces, chocker sets, earrings, etc. There are different types of handmade jewelry available.
                    The art of making Kundan jewelry is one of the oldest forms of handmade jewelry. The art is also known as “Kundankari”. Here the jewels are made from 24 carat gold, embedded with stones on one side and minakari work on the reverse side to get beautiful surfaces on both the sides. Both gold and silver is used for this work.Handmade ivory jewelry is exquisite to behold. Such jewelry is crafted from the tusks of animals like elephants, hippopotamuses, walruses, etc.

                                Khadi is a cloth woven using hand-operated loom with hand-spun yarn. The three varieties of Khadi are cotton, silk and wool. In 1925, Mahatma Gandhi established the first association of Khadi producers. In post independent India, the government of India at the federal level, and the provincial governments at the State level, set up promotional government bodies under the banner of Khadi & Village Industries Commission
                                 and Khadi & Village Industries Board respectively. One major concern of developing countries was, and still is, the generation of adequate employment opportunities and utilization of physical and
                                 human resource to the maximum advantage, particularly in rural areas where the majority of the population lives. This concern of India was reflected in the symbol of “charkha”, the spinning wheel which, next to agriculture is the most important source of income in rural India. Under the patronage of the Commission and Board, Khadi, this was hitherto a household, disorganized activity, and gradually evolved into a vibrant sector.

                Pickle-making has become a cottage industry in Atreyapuram, Narkidimilli, Ryali and Ankampalem. Especially in Narkidimilli, people of the entire village are busy running the cottage industry. The moment one enters the village, aroma of pickles wafts through the air. The condition is more or less the same in any street of the village. 
                We come across pickles stored in barrels. All women are involved in the preparation activity.They prepare the pickles mixing all ingredients in drums and stored as it is for a month. Afterwards, the pickle is transferred to another container and sold to customers. Special pickle is sold at Rs 60 a kg, while the ordinary variety at Rs 35 to 40 a kg. People of the village earn livelihood for about eight months in a year.
                Pickle-makers of these villages need at least 1000 tonnes of mangoes in the peak season. Manufacturers of pickle lament that there is no support from government for their trade though they have involved in this occupation for decades. In Atreyapuram, sugar-coated waffers (putarekulu) business have been overtaken by pickle industry.

The beginning of pottery making trails back to the Neolithic era. During the time of the Indus Valley Civilization, this effective art form improved with technology. In the present day, the pottery industry in India has been put forward as a major cottage industry as well as on the contemporary lines in both small and big pottery concerns.

                    The pottery industry in India provides mass employment along with betterment of the living standards; both the village and city people comprise the work force of the industry. Moreover, this industry is known to play a vital role in the total GDP of India and even in the foreign revenue.

                <p  class="content">
                    Baskets of conical shapes are invariably used for carrying purposes. They are commonly found among the Daflas, Hill-Miris, Tagins, Gallongs, Noctes and Wanchos. There are sufficient reasons to show that here is definite relationship between the topography and the conical shape of these baskets. The Dafla carrying basket, which is locally known as ege, may be regarded as one of the perfectly suited basket from technical point of view, as far as adaptation to the topography is concerned. Dafla villages are situated in the high spurs of mountain ranges. Their jhum fields, water sources and game reserves are located far away beyond the village limits. As a result, they have to carry their loads such as paddy, firewood, water tubes, etc., on their backs and climb high up the mountain. In this process with the basket on the back while climbing up, the carrier naturally has to bend in such a way as to form a 120-degree angle from the horizontal. Another feature of this Dafla basket is that it is more advantageous for carrying things.

                    The portion of the wall of the basket that rests upon the back of the carrier is almost flat and straight and the portion just opposite to it bulges outward. The flat portion is slightly flexible to rest comfortably on the back.

               A study that explores the livelihoods of the traditional tanners was conducted from
                November 2013 to April 2014 with the objective of assessing the prevailing traditional leather production and processing knowledge, business environment in Amhara 
                regional state of Ethiopia. In-depth interviews were carried out through direct observation, focal group discussion using a semi-structured questionnaire by interviewing 30 households located in 3 zones of Amhara region and those who work on 
                traditional tanning. The result indicated traditional leather products are important 
                household materials and income generating business especially for the rural community. To produce traditional leather products, they follow different steps and procedures and to facilitate this process in between, they apply different materials and 
                indigenous vegetables. The involvement of traditional tanners in the market is significant that the volume of raw cattle hide they absorb for producing traditional leather
                goods is more than 600,000 per annum. All the local tanners who work through the 
                process were made up of young and middle-aged men. By tradition, local tanners in 
                Ethiopia belong to a low-caster and are looked down upon by other parts of the 
                community.

                India has been the leading producer and consumer of dairy products worldwide since 1998 with a sustained growth in the availability of milk and milk products. Dairy activities form an essential part of the rural Indian economy, serving as an important source of employment and income.
                 India also has the largest bovine population in the world. However, the milk production per animal is significantly low as compared
                 to the other major dairy producers. Moreover, nearly all of the dairy produce in India is consumed domestically, with the majority of it being sold as fluid milk. On account of this, the Indian dairy industry holds tremendous potential for value-addition and overall development.

            <p  class="content">
                The invention of toys in India took place during the Indus Valley Civilization, approximately 8,000 years ago. The original toys comprised whistle-shaped parrots, toy monkeys with long hands to 
                slide down a rope or stick and miniature farm carts. All these toys were made from natural materials such as bamboo sticks, hay, and natural clay like soil, rocks, and fibre cloth. However, today, the advent of progressive
                 technology and mechanism has stimulated companies to produce fresh and inventive toys. Soon, owing to the new revolution of ‘Local se Vocal’, India is anticipated to become the global hub by 2025-2030.

                The Indian toy sector is expanding on the shoulder of a growing young population, rising disposable incomes, and a slew of innovations for the junior population base.

              The launch of “Make in India” is showing some positive results because, after the launch of the plan, India received investment commitments worth US$250 billion and investment inquiries worth US$23 billion between September 2014 to February 2016.
              Budget Allocation for Make in India in Union Budget 2020-21 :
              The total allocation for the Make in India programme was Rs 651.58 crore in 2019-20. In the Union Budget 2020-21, total allocation for the same increased to Rs 1,281.97 crore.
              In conclusion, it can be said that Make in India is a good initiative by the government of India and it can convert India from an importing economy into an exporting economy.
